switch statements
Practice: Write a function to determine whether a number is even or odd using if and switch.

3. Functions
Defining functions and parameters
Multiple return values
Named return values
Variadic functions
Practice: Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.

4. Arrays, Slices, and Maps
Array declaration and usage
Slice manipulation (append, copy, slicing)
Maps (key-value pairs)
Practice: Implement a program that finds the most frequent element in a slice of integers.

5. Pointers
Pointer basics (* and &)
Passing pointers to functions
Practice: Write a swap function that swaps two numbers using pointers.

6. Structs
Struct declaration and initialization
Methods on structs
Anonymous fields
Practice: Create a Person struct with fields for name and age, and implement a method to display the person's information.

7. Interfaces
Interface declaration and implementation
Type assertion

Practice: Create an interface Shape with methods Area and Perimeter. Implement it for Circle and Rectangle.

8. Error Handling
Error values

Defer, Panic, and Recover

Practice: Write a function to open and read a file. Handle possible errors (like the file not existing).

9. Concurrency (Goroutines and Channels)
Goroutines (go keyword)
Channels (sending and receiving data)
Buffered vs Unbuffered channels
Select statement
Practice: Write a program that uses a goroutine to fetch data and another one to process it concurrently using channels.

10. Packages and Modules
Creating your own package
Importing and using external packages
Managing dependencies with go mod
Practice: Split your program into multiple packages, separating logic into different files.

11. Go Routines and Syncing
sync.WaitGroup
Mutexes (sync.Mutex)
Practice: Use goroutines and mutexes to safely update a shared counter from multiple threads.

12. File I/O
Reading from and writing to files
Handling file operations and errors
Practice: Write a program to read data from one file, process it, and write the results to another file.

13. Reflection
Basic reflection in Go using the reflect package
Inspecting types and values at runtime
Practice: Write a function that uses reflection to print the type and value of any input.

14. Unit Testing
Writing tests in Go using the testing package
Table-driven tests
Benchmarks and Examples
Practice: Write tests for your Shape interface implementations and a benchmark for calculating areas.

15. Go Routines and Context
Managing cancellation and timeouts using context package
Practice: Write a program that runs multiple tasks and cancels them using the context package when a certain condition is met.

16. HTTP and Web Servers
Setting up a basic HTTP server using net/http
Handling requests and responses
Middleware and routing
Practice: Create a simple HTTP server that serves static files and responds with a JSON object for a specific route.

17. Database Interaction
Working with SQL databases using database/sql
Performing CRUD operations
Practice: Write a program that connects to a SQLite/PostgreSQL database and performs basic insert, update, delete operations.
